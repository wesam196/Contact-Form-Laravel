        <p>Mount Noor is the place where Allah honored His Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace be upon him) with
            prophethood. This is where he used to spend his time in worship of his Lord and in contemplation of Allah's
            creation.</p>
        <p class="py-0 my-0">
            In this cave, the history of mankind changed when Gabriel conveyed the revelation from Allah to Muhammad
            (blessings and peace be upon him). The first thing that was revealed was: {Read! In the name of your Lord
            Who creates. [He] creates man from a clot. Read! And your Lord is the Most Bounteous. It is He Who teaches
            by the pen. [He] teaches man that which he does not know.}

        <h5 class="text-white">The location of the Cave of Hira':</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>North of the Grand Mosque, at the top of Jabal An-Noor.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The cave is about 4.8 km (3 miles) from Makkah.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Elevation: approximately 634 m (2080 ft.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The cave is a natural void with its entrance towards the north, which can accommodate up to 9 sitting
                    people. It is about 1.6 m.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Please note: It is neither obligatory nor recommended to visit the cave as it has nothing to do with the
            Hajj rituals. It should be noted that it is difficult for the elderly and sick to reach the cave.

        <h1 class="text-page text-center py-5 text-white">Thawr Mount and Cave</h1>
        <div class="img-land-page">
            <img class="img-page mb-4"
                src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ar/3/38/%D8%AC%D8%A8%D9%84_%D8%AB%D9%88%D8%B1.jpg" alt=""

        </div>
        <p>
            situated atop Thawr Mountain, is a prominent historical site in Mecca, immortalized in the sacred verses of
            the Quran. It stands as a significant landmark on the northern side of Thawr Mountain, north of the holy
            capital. Thawr Cave remains ingrained in Islamic history, recounting the story of two individuals seeking
            refuge within its confines. With divine protection, it sheltered the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)
            and the esteemed companion Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) from the disbelievers of Mecca
        </p>
        <p>
            If you do not aid the Prophet - Allah has already aided him when those who disbelieved had driven him out
            [of Makkah] as one of two, when they were in the cave and he said to his companion, 'Do not grieve; indeed
            Allah is with us.' And Allah sent down his tranquility upon him and supported him with angels you did not
            see and made the word of those who disbelieved the lowest, while the word of Allah - that is the highest.
            And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise." (Quran, Surah At-Tawbah, 9:40)
        </p>
        <p>
            Historical accounts suggest that Thawr Cave was the first fortress in Islam where the Prophet Muhammad
            (peace be upon him) and his companion Abu Bakr sought refuge after the declaration of the divine call. The
            Prophet (peace be upon him) and Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) sought shelter there while on their
            way to Medina during the Prophetic Hijrah journey. They remained inside until the pursuit by the Quraysh
            subsided, then continued on their journey
        </p>
        <p>
            While they were in the cave, the Quraysh came searching for them, and they even reached the mouth of the
            cave. However, Allah repelled them by His favor and power. Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him)
            remarked, 'If one of them were to look down at his feet, he would see us below them.' The Prophet (peace be
            upon him) replied, 'O Abu Bakr, what do you think of two with whom Allah is the third?' This narration is
            reported in both Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim
        </p>
        <p>
            It has two openings: one to the east and one to the west and is located on the northern slope, at the top of
            Mount Thawr.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note: Visiting the cave is neither obligatory nor recommended as it has nothing to do with the Hajj
            rituals. It should be noted that it is difficult
        </p>
        <p>
            for the elderly and sick to reach the cave due to the long distance, rough terrain, and difficult
            accessibility.

                    for her 'Umrah. It took place after the Farewell Pilgrimage.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Aishah, (may Allah be pleased with her), wished to leave Makkah after performing both Hajj and 'Umrah
                    like the rest of the Companions, but she was unable to do 'Umrah due to the legitimate excuse that
                    had befallen her. So, after completing the Hajj, the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace be upon
                    him) ordered her brother to take her to Al-Tan'eem (the place of the mosque today) so that she would
                    enter into Ihram to do her 'Umrah.</p>

            <li>

            <li>
                <p>Whoever wants to reperform the 'Umrah has to enter into the state of Ihram from At-Tan'eem, after

            Makkah has a host of fascinating, intimate museums that shed light on the city’s history as the birthplace
            of Islam and a crossroads for travelers from all over the world for centuries. The Exhibition of the Two
            Holy Mosques guides
        </p>

        <p>
            visitors through the construction and many phases of the Masjid Al Haram in Makkah as well as the Masjid An
            Nabawi in Medina—browse intricate marble arches, reclaimed wooden doors and much more, saved and restored
            from previous iterations of the mosques. You’ll have to get permission to visit the Kiswah Museum next
            door—though it’s well worth to see where the kiswah, the 670-kilogram black silk cloth draped on the Kaaba,
            is made by hand, and woven with calligraphic inscriptions done in threads made from real gold and silver. At
            the Makkah Museum, set in the opulent Al Zahir Palace, you can learn about the region’s pre-Islamic history,
            dating back to ancient rock art, and see some early-Islamic coins from Byzantine, Abbasid and Umayyad
            dynasties as well as rare copies of centuries-old Qurans and other important texts.
